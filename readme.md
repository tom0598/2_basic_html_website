# Basic HTML Website

[Project Link on roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-html-website)

This project is a simple, multi-page website built using only HTML. It is designed to help you learn how to structure a website semantically, including the use of headers, footers, navigation bars, main content, and forms. No CSS or JavaScript is used—this project focuses solely on HTML structure and SEO meta tags.

## Features

- **Multiple Pages:**
  - Homepage (`index.html`)
  - Projects (`project.html`)
  - Articles (`articles.html`)
  - Contact (`contact.html`)
- **Navigation Bar:**
  - Present on all pages
  - Links to all main sections
- **Semantic HTML Structure:**
  - Uses `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.
- **SEO Meta Tags:**
  - Each page includes meta tags for description, keywords, author, and Open Graph properties
- **Contact Form:**
  - The contact page includes a form with fields for name, email, and message

## How to Use

1. Open any of the HTML files in your browser to view the website.
2. Use the navigation bar to move between pages.
3. The contact page contains a form (not functional, as there is no backend).

## Project Goals

- Learn to create and structure multiple HTML pages
- Practice semantic HTML for better accessibility and SEO
- Prepare a website for future styling with CSS

## Next Steps

After completing this project, you can move on to styling the website using CSS.
